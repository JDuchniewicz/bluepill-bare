# bluepill-bare
Rust bare metal code for Bluepill (STM32F103C8T6) MCU basing on the guides from: [interrupt.com](https://interrupt.memfault.com/blog/tag/zero-to-main/) and code from [zero-to-main](https://github.com/ferrous-systems/zero-to-main)

The code was adapted and modified for a Bluepill MCU and is capable of:
- [x] doing a simple blinky with User LED - Pin 13
- [ ] booting an arbitrary binary using a basic bootloader

This is an educational project and should NOT be used for anything else.
